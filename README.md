# Sarcasm-Detection-Model---Skripsi

The purpose of this Research was to build a Sentiment Analysis model for detecting sarcasm from public comments on politicians in Indonesia, using GloVe(Global Vectors for Word Representations) Algorithm to performed feature extractions, Bi-LSTM Algorithm to performed Classification, and SMOTE to performed Oversampling. The Datasets used were obtain from crawling on Twitter(X). In addition, this project also used SVM and LSTM Algorithms as a comparison. And here is the final result of this research.
